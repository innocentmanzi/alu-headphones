# Description
In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledge you previously learned.

You won't have a lot of instructions, and you are free to implement it the way you want. The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
